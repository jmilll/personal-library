# Personal Library

A web application that displays and stores books for your own personal library. Robust features (described below) and minimal display to keep your book library clean and organized.

Note: Adding a book, or clicking existing book buttons will store book data in your local storage. I've included a reset/clear button at the bottom of the library to clear everything if desired.
